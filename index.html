		<h2>About Anastasia</h2>
		<p>Anastasia is a 1997 American animated musical drama film produced and directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman. The film is a loose adaptation of the legend of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, which claims that she escaped the execution of her family. Its basic plot centers around an eighteen-year-old amnesiac orphan named Anya who, in hopes of finding some trace of her family, sides with con men who wish to take advantage of her likeness to the Grand Duchess.
